> Welcome to the Vectary Viewer API. A powerful yet simple to use set of parameters and Javascript methods to create interactive 3D applications on top of your Vectary projects.

## Vectary Viewer

?> Vectary is the easiest online 3D design & 3D modeling software on the web. For more information visit [Vectary homepage](https://www.vectary.com). To learn the basics of 3D modelling in Vectary, see the [Vectary Documentation](https://www.vectary.com/docs/).

As the only tool out there, **Vectary** and **Vectary Viewer** will give you full control of editing and presenting. 

In it's simplest form the Embed generated in Vectary, can be used as an iframe.

```html
<iframe id="e1ab67a8-689f-4fa0-a5e6-8fd7f6d57818" src="https://www.vectary.com/embed/viewer/v1/viewer.html?model=e1ab67a8-689f-4fa0-a5e6-8fd7f6d57818&env=default&envRotation=0&autoplay=1&turntable=0&showPreloader=1" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480"></iframe>
```
The line of HTML above will result in interactive 3D model loaded directly into your website. Just try rotating, zooming or panning the scene.
