> Welcome to the Vectary Viewer API. A powerful toolset that lets you create amazing interactive 3D applications on top of your Vectary projects.

## Vectary Viewer

?> Vectary is the easiest online 3D design & 3D modeling software on the web. For more information visit [Vectary homepage](https://www.vectary.com). To learn the basics of 3D modelling in Vectary, see the [Vectary Documentation](https://www.vectary.com/docs/).

As the only service out there, **Vectary** along with **Vectary Viewer** will cover your needs both in terms of creation and online presentation of your 3D work. 

In it's simplest form, the Viewer generated in Vectary editor, can be used as an iframe.

```html
<iframe 
    id="d6c1f27d-6a27-4c7e-bd7d-bd19d7faa56c" 
    src="https://www.vectary.com/viewer/v1/?model=d6c1f27d-6a27-4c7e-bd7d-bd19d7faa56c&turntable=-2" 
    frameborder="0" 
    width="100%" 
    height="480">
</iframe>
```
The line of HTML above will result in interactive 3D model loaded directly into your website. Just try rotating, zooming or panning the scene.
